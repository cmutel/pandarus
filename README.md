Pandarus is a GIS software toolkit for regionalized life cycle assessment. It is designed to work with [brightway LCA framework](https://brightwaylca.org), [brightway2-regional](https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2-regional), and [Constructive Geometries](https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/constructive-geometries).

For more information, including installation instructions, see the [online documentation](https://pandarus.readthedocs.io/), including a [usage example](https://github.com/cmutel/pandarus/blob/master/docs/usage_example.ipynb). Pandarus is only compatible with >= Python 3.8.

Pandarus provides the following functionality:

* [Overlay two vector datasets](https://pandarus.readthedocs.io/#intersecting-two-vector-datasets), calculating the areas of each combination of features using the Mollweide projection.
* Calculate the [area of the geometric difference](https://pandarus.readthedocs.io/#calculating-area-outside-of-intersections) (the areas present in one input file but not in the other) of one vector dataset with another vector dataset.
* [Calculate statistics](https://pandarus.readthedocs.io/#calculating-raster-statistics-against-a-vector-dataset) such as min, mean, and max when overlaying a raster dataset with a vector dataset.
* [Normalize raster datasets](https://pandarus.readthedocs.io/#manipulating-raster-files), including use of compatible `nodata` values
* Vectorization of raster datasets
